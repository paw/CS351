# HW 9 Angular/JS/Bootstrap/CGI Store

- a one page app with multiple views and a singular navigation component
- everything found in the angular part of the app (storeangular directory) is in this zip
- BUT it also still utilizes the following CGI scripts from hw #6/8 for backend stuff (not included in this zip):
    - store.cgi - http://74.79.35.66/~sullivb/hw/store_cgi.txt
    - invoice.cgi -  http://74.79.35.66/~sullivb/hw/invoice_cgi.txt
