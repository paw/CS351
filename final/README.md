# Scottblog Final: Scott's Easy Memo System
**Utilizes:** Node.js Websockets/Javascript, HTML/CSS, JSON, & SQLite.
**PORT:** 6789

- Functionality of creating and viewing memos is there
- Memos are stored in an SQLite3 Database
- I wanted to try to make it so the server would emit something else if there no messages available for a user, but was unable to do so in the time limit so I just commented that stuff out.
